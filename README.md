# The Problem
Dark patterns are a very sneaky yet rampant issue in today's online world. More than often we are sublimaly conditioned by them even without our own knowing, thus being held by very loose yet well wrapped strings as puppets, by those who have an interest in influencing our choice. Phishing and other online scams have a huge toll of victims as always, ever looming over everyone who uses the internet, waiting for a momentary lapse in their judgement, to pounce on.

## Who are affected by this ?
Everyone.
Everyone's affected by it, but it's impact is more on the elderly and the young, the less internet wise.

## Why ?
The issue of dark patterns is such a prevelant one that *the Ministry of Consumer Affairs of India, themselves issued a public statement calling for awareness* and even hosted a nation wide competition to encourage developers to look into solutions for the same. Phishing and online scams have put the entire world's cybersecurity forces on their heels.
Prevention is always better than cure, and fore warned is fore armed.

# Our goal
is to provide the user with a tool that would keep them informed and aware, during their time on the internet, thus keeping the user perceptive and wide awake, to any such attempts at phishing, online scams and dark patterns.

# How ? 
We have *designed a web extension* that uses the power of a _2 custom fine tuned LLMs, Merged, to provide a Single, Powerful and capable, Multimodal LLM_  to act as the brain of the entire system. The web extension extracts the content of all the websites you visit, including images, to analyze them for dark patterns. The web extension also analyzes emails and sms, when opened for scam or phishing attempts. 
Thus protecting the user from online threats.
